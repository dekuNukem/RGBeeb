Another neat side effect of using a PC case is that I can do away with the old power supply which tends to blow up if the RIFA capacitor is not removed. Modern ATX PSU had all the required voltages. now 


* Striking yet minimalist design
* Puts the motherboard on display front and center
* Lots of space, flexible & modular mounting options, no need to worry about PCI slots blocking analogue and econet ports.
* Mounting holes for water cooling can probably be used for 5.25 inch drives.


## Things to consider

Still 

* Finally, I really like its owl logo! Minimalist and whimsical, been using it as my profile photo for years!

Technically no modification is needed at all, I went quite far for aesthetic reasons.

And even though this kind of shenanigans seems one-off, back then users seemed to go a lot harder when it comes to modding.
show ebay machine, and then torch computer? both work.

Here's what

mention really dont like RGB gaming builds, i find them obnoxious and pointless. all my pcs are under the desk and i dont look at them when i use them!

almost all modern PC case doesn't have 5.25 inch bay anymore! there is just a blank space there. those who did does not support full height drive anymore as well, as they are optimised for optical drives and have half-height drives that prevent full height drives to be inserted. 

!!MEDIA TODO: screenshots of PC cases on amazon or newegg or uk equivalent?

I want my dual full-height drives, that means four(!) 5.25 inch bays! and its safe to say i wasnt able to find any gaming cases on sale today with that.


With modern cases a dead end, I started to look at cases around mid-2000s, where gaming PC were starting to become a thing, and 5.25" bays were yet to died out.

I then decided to turn my attention to a little eariler, and got myself a case from early 2000s. A handsome looking aluminum coolermaster full-size case. it has 4 bays and everything i need. its a nice case for a period build but still leaves me a bit cold. the major theme of this build is to contrast the 40 years old computer with modern enclosure, and using a 20 years old case just wasnt going to cut it.

not all modification are bad, if done properly can expand capabilites or aesthetics.

dumb it down a bit for regular readers and main stream tech blog editors.

show the owl case micro too? mention backstory, the sellers father were really good at those.

by what can only be described as sheer coincidence, 


for mockup, i used the bbc micro motherboard from the owl BBC, it didnt come with a PSU for some reason, after some testing i think i knew why. this one is in pretty rough shape, quite a few reworks and bodge wires, it works but is very unstable, it had a bad VIA, and then still usually crashes after a few minutes. strongly suspect an intermittent RAM program. still, just for mockup. 


## Trivia

* BBC Basic very fast

* Model A, B, B plus, etc, used by raspberry pi!

## Why?

Many projects putting new stuff in old cases, often destructively. I don't think that's right, and it's fun to see what I can do and how far I can push.

Pay omage to the users back then.

why not?
