*"But wait!"* I hear everybody cry out, *"doesn't BBC Micro already come with a keyboard?"*

Yes, but if I'm dragging a Beeb kicking and screaming into the RGB age, I might as well do it properly.

 The hardware is there but I haven't gotten around to write firmware for it, since so few programs use the mouse.

the keyboard for BBC micro is a very clever piece of design, it can scan its matrix autonomously without CPU involvement. An interrupt is generated when key press is detected, only then CPU starts to scan the matrix to see which key is pressed.

While doing PCB repairs I often shine a light from the back to check for solder bridges. The light passes through and illuminate the delicate and intricate design of all the traces on the circuit board.



I tested out the setup separately, and it seemed to work, so now I need to figure out how to mount them on the case.

fortunately the case has plenty of slots near the font for mounting water cooling heatsinks and fans, and looks like a simple metal bracket is all that;s needed.

I went to the local hardware store and bought some angle brackets that looked close enough, I then measured and drilled the holes for the drive. A one-piece solid metal bracket would be preferable, but i wasnt able to find off-the-shelf parts, custom fabrication would have been a lot more expensive.

anyway, the drives mounts fine, however when I line up the faceplate of the drive with the front of the case, the connectors on the back of the motherboard prevents the ribbon cable from being inserted. Still, it;s not a showstopper, I can fix that along with a few other planned modifcations. 

Speaking of which...

another0 goal of this project is to have real working full-height 5.25" floppy drives in the case. I had two candidates, a 80-track shugart model ??? from the frankenbeeb, and a 40 track Tandon model ??? from a IBM PC XT. With both 40 and 80 tracks, it should cover the majority of floppys I want to read.

I added a ???? floppy controller0 chip and tested out the setup. After some trail and error it seems that for the dual floppy to work, the ribbon cable needs to have NO TWIST, and the drive ID set manually with the on-board jumper. a terminating resistor might also be needed at the last drive on the cable. 

The acorn DFS treats each side of a floppy as different drives, so physical Drive ID 0 will be DFS drive 0 and 2, while drive ID 1 will be drive 1 and 3.

That means the timing is very tight once the 6502 starts keyboard query, I actually overclocked the microcontroller to be on the safe side, but in the end it does work rather nicely.

I also had to remap a few buttons since the keyboard layout is different on PC keyboards compared to BBC micro.

I used to on0board DAC for the joystick analog axies, which works fine, although careful calibration is needed to ensure the positiion is centred, as most games dont have calibration themselves.

The prototype p-card works fine with some bodge wires, and those will be fixed in the final version.


This is another happy coincidence that they did not use coppor ground planes or internal layers, both of which would block the light.

* Everything's in one place, no more separate boxes.

* Juxtaposition of old and new. 40 year old hardware in cutting edge 

* very much in the spirit

It sounded like an outrageous idea, but after bit of thinking, I felt it wasn't completely unrealistic.

The 5.25" floppy drives are designed to go into 5.25" bays, so no problem there. But what about the motherboard itself? I found a spare and did some measurements.

It breaks out all the common voltages in vintage computers, and has PWM fan and ARGB for cooling and aesthetic upgrades. It also fit into the 2.5" bay of a PC case, with standard power button and LED headers.

Another neat side effect of using a PC case is that I can do away with the old power supply which tends to blow up if the RIFA capacitor is not removed. Modern ATX PSU had all the required voltages. now 


* Striking yet minimalist design
* Puts the motherboard on display front and center
* Lots of space, flexible & modular mounting options, no need to worry about PCI slots blocking analogue and econet ports.
* Mounting holes for water cooling can probably be used for 5.25 inch drives.


## Things to consider

Still 

* Finally, I really like its owl logo! Minimalist and whimsical, been using it as my profile photo for years!

Technically no modification is needed at all, I went quite far for aesthetic reasons.

And even though this kind of shenanigans seems one-off, back then users seemed to go a lot harder when it comes to modding.
show ebay machine, and then torch computer? both work.

Here's what

mention really dont like RGB gaming builds, i find them obnoxious and pointless. all my pcs are under the desk and i dont look at them when i use them!

almost all modern PC case doesn't have 5.25 inch bay anymore! there is just a blank space there. those who did does not support full height drive anymore as well, as they are optimised for optical drives and have half-height drives that prevent full height drives to be inserted. 

!!MEDIA TODO: screenshots of PC cases on amazon or newegg or uk equivalent?

I want my dual full-height drives, that means four(!) 5.25 inch bays! and its safe to say i wasnt able to find any gaming cases on sale today with that.


With modern cases a dead end, I started to look at cases around mid-2000s, where gaming PC were starting to become a thing, and 5.25" bays were yet to died out.

I then decided to turn my attention to a little eariler, and got myself a case from early 2000s. A handsome looking aluminum coolermaster full-size case. it has 4 bays and everything i need. its a nice case for a period build but still leaves me a bit cold. the major theme of this build is to contrast the 40 years old computer with modern enclosure, and using a 20 years old case just wasnt going to cut it.

not all modification are bad, if done properly can expand capabilites or aesthetics.

dumb it down a bit for regular readers and main stream tech blog editors.

show the owl case micro too? mention backstory, the sellers father were really good at those.

by what can only be described as sheer coincidence, 


for mockup, i used the bbc micro motherboard from the owl BBC, it didnt come with a PSU for some reason, after some testing i think i knew why. this one is in pretty rough shape, quite a few reworks and bodge wires, it works but is very unstable, it had a bad VIA, and then still usually crashes after a few minutes. strongly suspect an intermittent RAM program. still, just for mockup. 


## Trivia

* BBC Basic very fast

* Model A, B, B plus, etc, used by raspberry pi!

## Why?

Many projects putting new stuff in old cases, often destructively. I don't think that's right, and it's fun to see what I can do and how far I can push.

Pay omage to the users back then.

why not?
