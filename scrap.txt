* Finally, I really like its owl logo! Minimalist and whimsical, been using it as my profile photo for years!

Technically no modification is needed at all, I went quite far for aesthetic reasons.

And even though this kind of shenanigans seems one-off, back then users seemed to go a lot harder when it comes to modding.
show ebay machine, and then torch computer? both work.

Here's what


not all modification are bad, if done properly can expand capabilites or aesthetics.

dumb it down a bit for regular readers and main stream tech blog editors.

show the owl case micro too? mention backstory, the sellers father were really good at those.

by what can only be described as sheer coincidence, 


for mockup, i used the bbc micro motherboard from the owl BBC, it didnt come with a PSU for some reason, after some testing i think i knew why. this one is in pretty rough shape, quite a few reworks and bodge wires, it works but is very unstable, it had a bad VIA, and then still usually crashes after a few minutes. strongly suspect an intermittent RAM program. still, just for mockup. 


## Trivia

* BBC Basic very fast

* Model A, B, B plus, etc, used by raspberry pi!

## Why?

Many projects putting new stuff in old cases, often destructively. I don't think that's right, and it's fun to see what I can do and how far I can push.

Pay omage to the users back then.

why not?
