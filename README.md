BBC Micro inside a open-frame ATX PC case 

## What's BBC Micro?

## Oh no! You butchered a piece of computing history!

Non-destructive, all modifications are reversible.

Technically no modification is needed at all, I went quite far for aesthetic reasons.

And even though this kind of shenanigans seems one-off, back then users seemed to go a lot harder when it comes to modding.

The original Torch computer is basically a BBC micro motherboard stuck in a case with a monitor, disk drives, and built-in keyboard with a few extra keys.

Show the photos I took at the computer museum, you can see the BBC micro motherboard mounted to the case.

Of course they went a bit further than that, adding a Z80 co-processor and CP/M capabilities. But the idea stands. (what idea?)

Which leads to another machine i picked up locally via ebay. here are the photos on that listing.

you can see this one went even further, putting the keyboard in its own case, a lid on the case to make it a box, and tons of upgrades! Seriously just look at all the ROMs.

dumb it down a bit for regular readers and main stream tech blog editors.

show the owl case micro too? mention backstory, the sellers father were really good at those.

It also came with a external disk drive with dual 5.25 inch floppies, and I spent some time documenting the whole thing and checked it through. Removed RIFA caps,hooked everything up, i didnt want to risk using the PSU inside the external drive so I hooked up a ATX PSU directly to it. I turned it on and it actually worked! All the ROMs are visiable, and it is quite a sight to behold:

which got me thinking, if i want to actually use it like that, wouldnt it be a lot nicer to put everything in the same case, like a ATX PC case?

## Figuring out whats needed, ATX size

That did seem like an outrageous idea, so I did some quite measurements. To my surprise, the size of the BBC micro motherboard is almost identical to the full-size ATX motherboard! BBC is ???mm by ???mm, and ATX is 305x244mm. here is a comparison:

adaptor plate

found a bbc micro motherboard i had laying around, this one is in pretty rough shape, quite a few reworks and bodge wires, it works but is very unstable, usually crashes after a few minutes. strongly suspect an intermiient RAM program. still, just for mockup.

tried out out in a 30 quid junk case, it acutlaly fits fine, looks strange though.





## case selection

with that out of the way, it really set things in motion, now i have to pick a PC case and think about the next steps.

self contained BBC micro with two disk drives inside a ATX case with PSU and working power buttons and LEDs just like a real PC.

at first i wanted a obnoxcious RGB esport gaming case just for the shit of it, but
